	abstract = {A predominant purpose of vision is to facilitate interaction with the world. Motivated by biological vision, we argue that many common vision-guided activities can be carried out directly on the basis of features of appearance, and do not require elaborate world models. We describe a visual feature learning system that supports a hapticallyguided, dextrous robotic grasping system. It learns features, combinations of Gaussian-derivative filter responses, that correlate well with successful grasping parameters. Without explicit knowledge of object identities or categories, the system learns to propose object-specific grasp parameters, considerably improving the quality of hapticallyguided grasps with respect to the ``blind'' system. The combined system is loosely anthropomorphic in that it is guided by vision for hand pre-shaping, and by haptics during execution of a grasp, without explicit object recognition, scene reconstruction, or path planning.},
